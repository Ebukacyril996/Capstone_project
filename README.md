Loan Repayment & Bitcoin Allocation Analysis 


Project Overview
This project explores the impact of allocating 10% of monthly loan repayments to Bitcoin over a 4-year period. The analysis includes financial simulations, repayment tracking, and data visualization using Python and Power BI.

Objectives
Analyze how Bitcoin allocation affects overall loan repayment.
Compare financial outcomes with and without Bitcoin allocation.
Identify key loan trends by month, state, and profession.
Assess tax implications after Bitcoin liquidation.
Generate insights through Python (data processing) and Power BI (visualizations).

Loan ID: Unique identifier for each loan.
Customer Name: Anonymized for privacy.
Loan Amount: Principal loan value.
Monthly Repayment: Scheduled payment per month.
Bitcoin Allocation: 10% of the repayment amount converted into BTC.
