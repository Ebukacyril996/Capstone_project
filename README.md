The analysis includes financial simulations, repayment tracking, and data visualization using Python and Power BI. The result is then compared to regular savings and savings with the S&P.

Objectives
- Analyze how Bitcoin allocation affects overall loan repayment.
- Compare financial outcomes with and without Bitcoin allocation.
- Identify key loan trends by state and uses of loans.
- Generate insights through Python (data processing) and Power BI (visualizations).

Loan ID: Unique identifier for each loan.
Customer Name: Random generated names for privacy.
Loan Amount: Principal loan value.
